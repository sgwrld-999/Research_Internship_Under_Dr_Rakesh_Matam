Voting Ensemble Implementation

This module provides a comprehensive implementation of Voting Ensemble-based 
classifiers for multiclass classification tasks.

THEORY - Voting Ensemble Learning:
==================================

Voting ensemble is a machine learning technique that combines multiple different 
machine learning algorithms for the same predictive task. The main principle is 
that a diverse set of models can collectively produce better results than any 
individual model.

1. VOTING TYPES:
   - Hard Voting: Majority rule, each model gets one vote
   - Soft Voting: Average predicted probabilities, weighted by model confidence

2. ENSEMBLE BENEFITS:
   - Reduced overall error through model diversity
   - Better generalization than individual models
   - Robust against outliers and noise in data
   - Lower sensitivity to overfitting
