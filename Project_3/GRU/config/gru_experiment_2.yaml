# GRU Model Configuration for Network Intrusion Detection
# =========================================================
# 
# THEORY - Configuration Design:
# =============================
# This configuration follows the principle of "Configuration as Code":
# - All model parameters are externalized
# - Easy to version control and track changes
# - Enables experiment reproducibility
# - Supports automated hyperparameter tuning

# === Core Architecture Parameters ===
input_dim: 14 # Number of features per time step (updated to match dataset)
seq_len: 128 # Number of time steps in sequence
num_classes: 5 # Classification categories: Recon, Exploitation, C&C, Attack, Benign
gru_units: 32 # Hidden state dimension (memory capacity)
num_layers: 4 # Stack depth (complexity vs. training stability)

# === Regularization Configuration ===
dropout: 0.3 # Dropout rate for preventing overfitting (30% of neurons)
bidirectional: true # Process sequences in both directions

# === Training Hyperparameters ===
learning_rate: 0.001 # Adam optimizer step size
batch_size: 64 # Optimized batch size for better CPU/GPU utilization
epochs: 15 # Maximum training iterations
validation_split: 0.2 # Fraction for validation (20%)
early_stopping_patience: 2 # Stop if no improvement in 2 epochs

# === Monitoring and Evaluation ===
metrics: # Performance metrics to track for multi-class classification
  - accuracy     # Overall correctness
  - precision    # Positive predictive value (macro averaged)
  - recall       # Sensitivity to positive class (macro averaged)
  - f1_score     # Balance between precision and recall (macro averaged)

# === Model Persistence ===
export_path: "/fab3/btech/2022/siddhant.gond22b@iiitg.ac.in/Project_3/GRU/models/saved_Models/gru_experiment2.keras" # Where to save trained model

# === Advanced Configuration (Optional) ===
# Uncomment and modify these for advanced usage:
# 
# optimizer_config:
#   type: "adam"
#   beta_1: 0.9
#   beta_2: 0.999
#   epsilon: 1e-7
# 
# regularization:
#   l1: 1e-5
#   l2: 1e-4
#   recurrent_dropout: 0.1
# 
# callbacks:
#   early_stopping:
#     patience: 10
#     monitor: "val_loss"
#   reduce_lr:
#     factor: 0.5
#     patience: 5
